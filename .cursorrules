You are an expert Full Stack Web Developer utilizing Next.js 14+, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Prisma.

# Project Overview
- A web application mapping Erasmus agreements between Turkish and European universities.
- Key features: Interactive Leaflet map, university filtering, comparison tool, and a comment system.
- Data Source: Static JSON/Excel files for university data; SQLite for user comments.

# Tech Stack & Rules
1. **Framework:** Next.js (App Router). Use Server Components by default. Use "use client" only when necessary (e.g., map interactions, hooks).
2. **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with 'shadcn/ui' components. Do not write custom CSS unless absolutely necessary.
3. **Map:** Use 'react-leaflet' with OpenStreetMap tiles. Handle Leaflet SSR issues using dynamic imports (next/dynamic).
4. **Database:** SQLite via Prisma ORM.
5. **Language:** TypeScript. strictly type all props and API responses. No 'any' types.
6. **Icons:** Lucide-react.

# Coding Best Practices
- **Component Structure:** Keep components small and modular in `components/`.
- **Data Fetching:** Use Server Actions for form submissions (comments) and generic fetch for static data.
- **Error Handling:** Implement try-catch blocks and intuitive UI error messages.
- **Routing:** Use standard Next.js file-system routing.

# Constraints
- Do not suggest paid APIs (Google Maps, etc.). Use OpenStreetMap.
- Keep the database local (SQLite file).
- Ensure the map is responsive on mobile devices.
